All images and videos\nfrom the folder and from all subfolders will be analyzed. Depending on the amount of images, this might take a while. Note that the last selected folder will be re-opened when\nImageSieve is started for the next time.\n\nOnce the folder has been processed, a list of file names will appear in the box to the right. This list contains the files that have been found in the folder and that will be\nconsidered in the sieving process. Each file has a set of icons that indicate its state.\n\nThe following icons are used (exact rendering depends on platform/font):\n\n- ðŸ“·: The file is an image\n- ðŸ“¹: The file is a video\n- ðŸ—‘: The file is discarded\n- ðŸ”€: There are similar files to this one\n- ðŸ“…: File is in the date range of an event\n\nTo select a file, click it and it will be shown in the image area. Below the image, some details about the file are listed. In order to discard an image, just click it and it will\nbe displayed in a translucent way. As an alternative, you can hit the space bar to toggle between discarded and kept state. To navigate between images, you can use the \"â¬…\nPrevious\" and \"Next âž¡\"  buttons or hit the left and right key on your keyboard.\nIf you want to open an image or a video with the default application in your OS, click the \"ðŸ“‚ Open\" button or press the \"Enter\" key.\n\nIf an image belongs to a group of similar images, all these similar images are displayed below the current image. The currently selected one is highlighted in blue. To navigate\nbetween similar images, you can use the up and down key.\n\nNote that video files are also displayed in the list of images and previewed as a 3x3 matrix of screenshots. Similiarities are not calculated for video files.";

Events are named date spans that will provide a target folder name during the sieve\nprocess, like \"2021-10-07 - 2021-10-10 Cool trip\". All images taken in the given period of time will be put into that folder. You can specify an arbitrary number of events, but\nbe aware that in case of overlapping dates, an image is put into the folder of the first matching event.\n\nTo add an event, fill the start date, end date and name text box and click the \"âž• Add\" button. Valid date formats are YYYY-MM-DD or DD.MM.YYYY. You can edit existing events by\nmodifying their fields and pressing enter - the updated values will be taken over and be visible in the event's caption when you click the \"ðŸ’¾ Update\" button. To remove an event,\nclick the \"ðŸ—‘ Remove\" button.\nThe time spans of events must not overlap.\n\nBe aware that the events are saved in the currently selected folder along with the selection of images.";
