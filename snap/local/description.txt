ImageSieve aims to help in the process of sorting through images taken by several people with several devices and collect the images worth keeping in a folder structure suitable for archiving or to eliminate potential duplicates or irrelevant images from a folder structure. 

**Features**
* Browse images in jpg, tiff or png format and videos in mp4, avi and mts format from a folder structure in the order of their creation
* Select which images to keep and which to discard
* Images which resemble each other and images being taken within a customizable number of seconds are considered similar and are highlighted to support sorting
* Manage events with a name, a start and an end date for the images to sort to automatically assign the images to an event
* Discarded images and events are saved so that the sorting process can resume later
* Sieve the images by either deleting discarded ones, copying or moving kept images to a target folder
